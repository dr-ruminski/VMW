/**
	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional 
	HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin,
	access to selected resources from a different origin. 
	A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource 
	that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.
	More you can find on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
