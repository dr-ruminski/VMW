**V**irbo **M**otors **W**earable is an open-source device for enhancing Mixed Reality applications with tactile human-machine hand interactions. The presented device is capable of providing tactile feedback while interacting with virtual objects, e.g., when elements of a 3D user interface are touched. The device enables to run vibro motors mounted on a user's fingers while interacting with synthetic objects.
In order to control the vibe of a particular vibro motor in a wireless manner, an HTTP-based API has been developed. 
The API can be used to develop mobile-tactile Mixed Reality applications to enhance user experience by giving an impression of fading in/out effects when interacting with 3D objects.
